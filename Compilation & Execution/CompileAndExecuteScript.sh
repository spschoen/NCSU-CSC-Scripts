# CSC 116 Automated 'Grading' Tool.  Will compile and execute files #

# Moodle.  Generates 2 output files for each step - an              #
# output_[step].txt file, and an output_[step]_error.txt file,      #
# both from stdout and stderr.                                      #

# A quick note on how to download student submissions from Moodle.  #
#  (As well as setting up for the script)                           #
# 1. Go to the assignment quick grade page.                         #
# 2. From the drop-down menu next to 'Grading Action', choose       #
#    'Download all Submissions'.  It will download an archive file. #
# 3. Save this archive as described in the directory structure      #
#    diagram as detailed below, and extract it so your setup        #
#    matches the expected.  Then, delete the archive file.          #
# 4. Run the script.
