# Fall 2016 Scripts
This is the NCSU Repository for scripts created/used during the Fall 2016 semester of CSC 116.
Scripts can range from simply renaming files and creating folders, to completely grading them.
The preferred method of organization is by purpose of script:
* Rename
  *  RenameScript.java
  * ...
* Report Creation
* ...

Each folder will have an index of each script, with information on author (and email), language, description, and documentation on executing the script (even if it's documented in the script itself).

Please contact the specific authors of each script if you have a question. If editing a script that isn't yours, please make a separate branch and alert the original author - we don't want delicate scripts to break.
