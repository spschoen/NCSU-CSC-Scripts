# File Distribution Scripts
This scripts will move files from location to location, such as transferring DrawingPanel.java to each student's folder. More than likely, used by other scripts.

Index:
* copyfile.sh
  * Written by Samuel Schoeneberger (spschoen@ncsu.edu)
  * Bash / Shell
  * Reminder of code; non-functional.
  * Will take file (DrawingPanel.java) and transfer it to subdirectories for later use.
  * Very specific use, basically a single line of shell scripting.
